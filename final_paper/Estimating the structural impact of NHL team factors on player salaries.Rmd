abstract: |
  When NHL players and teams are negotiating contracts, player statistics are an obvious
  bargaining point. Less obvious are the characteristics inherent to individual teams. In this paper,
  we examine whether certain teams have different average salaries, controlling for individual statistics
  contributions and statistics. Specifically, we want to see if the effective tax rates a team's players
  are subject to, or if certain teams have a lower expected salary, given a certain player's statistics.
